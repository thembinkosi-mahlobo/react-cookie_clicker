# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

🎯 Please mention the requirements you met and which goals you achieved for this assignment.
I set out to build a user friendly and functioning cookie clicker, where user can click to earn cookies and spend them on upgrades. Also, made an alert function for users with less cookies to made aware they can’t upgrade until they have earned enough cookies.

🎯 Were there any requirements or goals that you were not quite able to achieve?
I had a creative stretch goal in mind of, an effect such as cookies raining down the screen when a user has earned a reward. Also wanted to add sound effect to the click button. I become nervous that I would break my current code as it is working as should.

🎯 If so, could you please tell us what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
I found useeffect was a challenge but manageable. However, what I found difficult was adding image but eventually with support from instructors I started to understand where I was wrong in writing my code.

(Optional)
🏹 Feel free to add any other reflections you would like to share about your submission e.g.

What went really well and what could have gone better?
Detailing useful external sources that helped you complete the assignment (e.g Youtube tutorials).
Describing errors or bugs you encountered while completing your assignment.
I enjoyed working on this week’s project. Although it was challenge, nerve racking and stressful when the code did not work.  
I utilised support from instructor to help with debugging. Also, group discussion help motivate me to revisit my code.
I used Moodle to remind me how to write code that I was struggling with.
